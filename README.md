# Fourier Potential Method for diffusion MRI simulation

Fourier representation of the diffusion MRI signal using layer potentials

- demo_torch.py gives an exmaple of constructing meshes and running simulations.
- FPM contains two modules: geometry module and solver module.
- neuron_models contains one realistic neuron model.
